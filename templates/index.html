        A little about us
      </h2>

      <hr />

      <p>
        We're two close friends, who eventually got burnt out of seeing
        apps, which did "unnecessarily more" than they're supposed to do. We
        really wanted to challenge this common principle by building our own
        apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, as any knowledgable developer would've done - we started to
        code.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, both of us were backend and systems developers, and had
        little to no prior knowledge of app development. How could we even
        pull this off?
      </p>

      </blockquote>

      Now what's so fascinating about this quote? It's because, as
      developers advance more through tech each year, the design principles
      even the basic apps follow become more "scattered". That's what we're
      here to solve -
